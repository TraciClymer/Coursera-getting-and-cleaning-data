###Readme file for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" final project

##Overview
###The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

###One of the most exciting area in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used linked below represent data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

##Source Data
###https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Project Instructions
###You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
####1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
####2.Extracts only the measurement on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
####3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
####4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
####5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable activity and each subject

##Additional Info
###More detailed information about the variables, data, and transformations can be found in the "codebook.md" file
